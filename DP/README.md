# Questions:
1. **Can you reduce the space complexity?**
- You solve the 2D DP efficiently and have time left. The interviewer might ask you to reduce the space complexity to 1D DP.
- The 1D DP solution is slightly less readable than the 2D version, so the interviewer may ask you to weigh the trade-offs (e.g., space savings vs. code complexity). This tests your ability to make informed design decisions.

3. **What if the input strings are very large?**
- for large inputs (e.g., m = 10.000, n = 10.000), 2D consumes a lot of memory
- How you think about trade-offs (e.g., memory vs. code complexity) in a real-world scenario where memory is a constraint.
- if memory is critical, we should go with 1D DP optimization
